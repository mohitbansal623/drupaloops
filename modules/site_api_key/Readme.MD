Drupal 8 Site API Key Module

In this module, I have added a textfield by which we will be able to save API key in a variable.

After this I have created a form on URL /site_api_key_form which will take NID and API Key from a user. If a user enters API Key and it matches with a Actual Site API Key and along with this NID entrered will be of Basic Page Content type. If this criteria matches then a node title will be displayed otherwise access denied message will be displayed.
